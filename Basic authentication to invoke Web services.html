	All authentication issues for TopBraid Suite are handled by using standard J2EE Web container methods. Once inside the container, users are free to design
	their own RBAC designs, such as TopBraid EVN's Vocabulary User Roles. Some of the details will depend on the authentication Realm set up for Tomcat - i.e.
	LDAP, AD, etc. However, authentication is always a handshake between the entity requiring access and the Web container (e.g. Tomcat), not TopBraid Suite
	applications.
</p>
<p>
	Authentication works the same across all HTTP methods.
</p>
<p>
	The following outlines some basic concepts and suggestions for handling authentication from user and services. There are a number of ways to support
	authentication, and many organizations choose to build their own. Organization-specific IT policies will largely dictate interactions with the Web
	container to authenticate users and services. Therefore, TopQuadrant can only play an advisory role for getting started with authentication issues
</p>
<p>
	For more about authentication methods for J2EE, a good starting point is http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/Security5.html. The authentication
	method is chosen in the initial Deployment Descriptor Configuration wizard (see xxxxxxxxxxx), which sets the login-config/auth-method element in the
	web.xml file. Only one authentication form can be used per server. TopBraid supports Form, Basic and no authentication:
</p>
<p>
	1) No Authentication. No user id or password is required to invoke services. This is useful for Linked Open Data applications and applications are are used
	openly behind firewalls.
</p>
<p>
	2) Form-based authentication. This is the best choice for all UI-based applications, such as EVN, TBI, and SWA/SWP-based applications. Form-based
	authentication will display a form for entering authentication, pass the challenge to the authentication agent, and respond with the challenge result. On
	logout, the user is logged out from the container.
</p>
<p>
	3. Basic authentication. This should be used for access via 3rd party entities, such as Web services. It is not convenient for user-based authentication
	because the user cannot log out of the system without closing the browser. It is recommended to use Basic authentication when the server is used for Web
	services and an administrator needs to occasionally log in to perform maintenance.
</p>
<p>
	A common enterprise architecture is to define one server with Form-based authentication for end-user access and a second server with Basic authentication
	for access by Web services. In addition to utilizing the different authentication methods, this architecture facilitates balancing loads between user and
	service-based access.
</p>
<p>
	**End User Authentication**
</p>
<p>
	If user log-in is required, then it is best to use Form authentication. In this case the application (TBL/EVN) controls the login and logout pages that are
	displayed to the user. When a user logs out, they are logged out from the Web application container.
</p>
<p>
	Some user information is cached in the /server.topbraidlive.org/dynamic/users.ttl file of the active TopBraid workspace. This information is passed to
	TopBraid from the Web application container at login. Helper functions are available from any SPARQL context, including smf:currentUserName(),
	smf:hasCurrentUser(), and smf:userWithName().
</p>
<p>
	**Web Service Authentication**
</p>
<p>
	Basic authentication should be used for access by Web services. Basic authentication relies on a Base64 encoded 'Authorization' header whose value consists
	of the word 'Basic' followed by a space followed by the Base64 encoded name:password. This is better suited for service-only access because the only way a
	user can log out is to shut down their browser. In this case, you can submit the URL with header information. Here's an example using cURL to access a
	SPARQLMotion service named ‘DisplaySimpleHtml’ in TopBraid:
</p>
<p>
	curl -H "Authorization: Basic c2NvdHQ6MTIzNDU=" -X POST "http://localhost:8080/evn/tbl/sparqlmotion?id=DisplaySimpleHtml"
</p>
<p>
	GET works as well. The base 64 in the middle is "scott:12345".
</p>
<p>
	curl -H "Authorization: Basic c2NvdHQ6MTIzNDU=" -X POST
	"http://localhost:8080/evn/tbl/sparql?default-graph-uri=http://topbraid.org/examples/kennedys&amp;format=application/sparql-results+json&amp;query=SELECT
	?s WHERE {?s a &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class&gt;}"
</p>
<p>
	curl -H "Authorization: Basic c2NvdHQ6MTIzNDU=" -X POST "http://localhost:8080/evn/tbl/sparql?query=SELECT ?s WHERE { GRAPH
	&lt;http://topbraid.org/examples/kennedys&gt;{?s a &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class&gt;}}"
</p>

</p>
<p>
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx wget has a similar protocol. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</p>
<p>
	For secure access, Web services should use https encryption.
</p>
<p>
	Access using Form-based authentication, while not recommended, is possible using cookies generated by the server. One method is to respond to the challenge
	with a hardcoded URL with a valid user id and password. The general form of this response is:
</p>
<p>
	http://[host]:[port]/j_security_check?J_username=[username]&amp;j_password=[password]
</p>
<p>
	Another method is to request a http cookie that can be used in subsequent requests. The following is an example script for accessing a TopBraid EVN
	Form-based server. In summary the script a) requests a cookie, ‘init_cookie’, using GET or POST b) if login is successful, the client will receive a
	cookie, ‘evn_cookie’ that is saved for use in subsequent requests, and c) uses the cookie to request TopBraid EVN services, such as the SPARQL endpoint
	call in the example.

<p>
	Assuming the following is defined in a file named ‘authenticateCallService.sh’:
</p>
<p>
	——
</p>
<p>
	#!/bin/bash
</p>
<p>
	#The script needs the servername:portnumber, username and password respectively to work correctly.
</p>
<p>
	if [[ $# -ne 3 ]] ; then
</p>
<p>
	echo 'Invalid command. Please run authenticate script in following format ./authenticateCallService &lt;servername:port&gt; &lt;username&gt;
	&lt;password&gt;'
</p>
<p>
	exit 1
</p>
<p>
	fi
</p>
<p>
	curl -c ~/init_cookie -X POST "http://$1/evn/tbl" -D ~/firstReqHeaders &gt; /dev/null
</p>
<p>
	#The server sends a new cookie as a response to this request. Use that cookie for subsequest requests.
</p>
<p>
	curl -b ~/init_cookie -X POST "http://$1/evn/tbl/j_security_check" -H "Context-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data
	"j_username=$2&amp;j_password=$3" -L "http://$1/evn/tbl" -c ~/evn_cookie -D ~/secReqHeaders
</p>
<p>
	curl -b ~/evn_cookie -X POST "http://$1/evn/tbl/sparql" -G --data-urlencode "query=SELECT * WHERE{?s a &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class&gt;} "
	--data-urlencode "default-graph-uri=http://topbraid.org/examples/kennedys" --data "format=json" -D ~/thirdReqHeaders
</p>
<p>
	——
</p>
<p>
	The script can be invoked by the command:
</p>
<p>
	./authenticateCallService &lt;servername:port&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</p>
<p>
	For secure access, Web services should use https encryption.

<p>
	**RBAC in TopBraid**
</p>
<p>
	TopBraid does not directly handle user authentication, which is performed by an authentication layer, such as LDAP or AD, the interacts with the Web
	application container (Tomcat). Once a user has passed the authentication challenge from the Web application, the user id and roles are cached in TopBraid.
	An important implication is that the TopBraid infrastructure cannot know about the existence of a user until they have successfully logged in to the Web
	container.
</p>
<p>
	Once a user has successfully passed authentication by the Web container, user information is cached in a file named
	/server.topbridlive.org/dynamic/users.ttl int he TopBraid workspace. Useful SPARQL functions for access to user information accessible by TopBraid include
	the following:
</p>
<p>
	- smf:currentUserName: Gets the name of the user that is currently logged into TopBraid. Should be preceded by smf:hasCurrentUser to avoid exceptions.
</p>
<p>
	- smf:userWithName: Converts a user name into a URI resource, following the default settings in TopBraid. Often used in conjunction with
	smf:currentUserName().
</p>
<p>
	- teamwork:currentUserHasPrivilege: Checks whether the currently logged in user has a given privilege, specified by a role property. The current user must
	have that role or a sub-property thereof, for the given governed resource. The query will be executed on the given team graph.
</p>
<p>
	Please see Help &gt; TopBraid Composer &gt; SPARQL Function Reference in TopBraid Composer for more information on these and other functions.
</p>
<p>
	Note that there is no connection between TopBraid and LDAP/AD/other authentication systems. TopBraid simply caches some user information at login that can
	be accessed by TopBraid solutions.
