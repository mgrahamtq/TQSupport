      <section id="introduction">
         <p>Prior to installation of Enterprise Vocabulary Net, there are a few configuration issues to consider, as described in the following sections.</p>

         <p><sup>* Please contact TopQuadrant concerning use of Windows Server 2008.<br>
               ** Ubuntu 9.10 is known not to work.<br>
               *** Tomcat 6.0.28 or greater provides better memory leak protection than earlier versions and is recommended. Earlier versions
               of Java/Tomcat 6 are expected to work but are known to have memory leaks that affect some Enterprise Vocabulary Net functions.</sup></p>
         <p>Details and suggested configurations for <a href="#tomcatUnderLinux">Linux</a> and <a href="#c20">Windows 2003</a> are included in this document.

      <section>
         <h2>Suggested Java Configuration</h2>
         <div class="admon"><img align="left" vspace="0px" hspace="30px" width="60px" src="img/icon-tip.jpg"><p class="p">If you are using both TopBraid Live and TopBraid Enterprise Vocabulary Net on the same server, we recommend that you run each
               in a separate JVM by running them with separate instances of Tomcat. 
            </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            It is necessary to ensure that you have adequate physical memory
            to run Enterprise Vocabulary Net and that you have configured your Web Application
            Server to use it.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Adequate heap space must be configured, and, when using Sun's JVM, adequate Permanent Generation space needs to be allocated.
            This 
            requires setting parameters for the JVM.  Using the Oracle/Sun JVM the recommended JAVA_OPTS  are:
            
         </p><pre class="pre">-XX:MaxPermSize=256m 
-XX:PermSize=256m
-Xmx4g
      </pre><p>Note that the XX parameters use the equals sign but Xmx does not. The 4g value for Java heap space (-Xmx) represents a minimum
            allocation for EVN servers.  A value such as <code>-Xmx=5120m</code> (any integer 
            value is acceptable, not just increments of 1204) would be expected for most servers, provided adequate physical memory is
            available. 
         </p>
         <p>These parameters must be assigned on the JVM running the Web Application Server (e.g. Tomcat). If this figure is too low,
            then the most likely 
            error is a HTTP 500 server error on the first page accessed after an Equinox reset, or after a EVN nightly restart. See the installation instructions 
            below for your operating system for more details concerning how to set the parameters.
         </p>
         <p>If you are using Tomcat and plan to deploy and undeploy EVN using the manager application or API, add the following JAVA_OPTS as well:</p><pre class="pre">
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled 
</pre></section>

         <h2>Other Issues to Consider Prior to Installation</h2>
         <p>The following issues may need configuration on your system.</p>
         <!-- removed 2012-04-11 srh
This configuration is done by editing the <code>web.xml</code> file
used for TopBraid Live.
</p>
<p>The <code>web.xml</code> file from the TBL 
 <code>tbl.war</code> web application archive file
is included. This can be edited, and,
at the appropriate step below, copied to the correct location.

</p>
<section><h3>Workspace Location</h3>
<p>TopBraid Live requires a workspace compatible with the Eclipse Equinox implementation of the OSGi R4 framework. (This is similar to the TopBraid Composer workspace.)
 The default location, which may be modified in TopBraid Live's <code>web.xml</code> file,  is <code>/var/lib/ontologies</code>.
This workspace location  must be writable by the process running the Web Application Server.
</p></section>
-->
         <section>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <!-- <p>In order to configure security, Tomcat must be configured to connect to an 
authentication realm to provide users and their roles. One such realm 
would be a connector to LDAP.  
With no such configuration all TopBraid Live  operations, including administrative ones,
are available to anyone with network access to the server.
</p>
<p>Authentication is also configured by appropriate modifications to 
TopBraid Live's <code>web.xml</code> file.
</p>
-->
            <p>The Apache Tomcat $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml file stores contain user IDs and passwords.  Unless you've configured
               Tomcat to use some other authentication method (LDAP, Kerberos, various single-signon approaches), you can use a user ID and
               password from this file.
            </p>
            <p>Tomcat installations (and J2EE servers in general) generally assume that authentication occur from some outside source.  Out
               of the box, Tomcat is configured to use tomcat-users.xml to load authentication information into memory.  If, for example,
               LDAP is used instead, then a user trying to log into a Tomcat application will send information from the sign-in (either Basic
               or Form in EVN) to the authentication service, which responds with role/user id information. This then placed in Tomcat memory just like
               it is done when using tomcat-users.xml.
            </p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>Internet Explorer and SSL</h3>
            <p>For your users using TopBraid applications from Internet Explorer over SSL, certain settings in your httpd.conf file will
               ensure that the application's behavior will be consistent with its use from other browsers. The following shows the end of
               a VirtualHost element in an httpd.conf file, with the IE-related lines in bold.
            </p><pre class="pre">
   SSLEngine On

   SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT:!SSLv2:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM
   SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

   SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.key

   SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/ca/sub.class1.server.ca.pem
   SSLCACertificateFile    /etc/ssl/ca/ca.pem
   <strong>
   SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" is_ie nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

   #Needed for IE Flash image loading bug
   Header set Cache-Control no-store env=is_ie
   Header unset Pragma env=is_ie
   </strong>
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre><p>The SetEnvIf line sets a series of environment variables to true for user agents with MSIE in their name, and the two Header
               lines adjust the HTTP header that will be sent to the browsers.
            </p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h3>J2EE Memory Management Issues</h3>
            <p>Many J2EE apps suffer memory leaks.
               TopQuadrant's continuous integration server checks for memory leaks in Enterprise Vocabulary Net
               and such problems are regularly addressed.
               However, since your usage pattern differs from TopQuadrant's test scripts,
               you may have problems that have gone undetected before.
               These are noticeable when you stop and restart from Tomcat's admin module; 
               after stopping Enterprise Vocabulary Net, wait five minutes and then
               select the find leaks option from Tomcat's admin page.
            </p>
            <p>The most severe leaks make it impossible to cleanly shutdown Tomcat
               and a "kill -KILL" command may be necessary.
               If problems continue, the most effective defect report is to send TopQuadrant support a memory dump of your Tomcat server.
            </p>
            <p>To make one, first find the process ID of your Tomcat process, and then issue the following command:</p><pre>
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=TB-dump.bin $PID
</pre><p>Then, compress the file TB-dump.bin and make it available to TopQuadrant support.</p>
