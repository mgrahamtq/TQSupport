	<strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The TopBraid Role Management utility is found in the Server Administration page for all TopBraid server products. It provides a way to manage access
	controls to TopBraid Assets such as graphs, files, Eclipse/Equinox projects, Web services, etc. Access control Groups are defined in Role Management to
	define access rights to Assets and associate the Groups to Roles defined in Tomcat Realms, such LDAP, and LDAP/MS Active Directory, and Tomcat’s in-memory
	user database (conf/tomcat-users.xml).

<p>
	The overall access control design is depicted in the diagram below. Note that Roles and user associations with Roles are defined outside of TopBraid by
	Tomcat Realm administration, such as LDAP/MS Active Directory.
</p>

	<a name="_Toc260381644">1. Installation and Admin Setup</a>
</h1>
<p>
	Initial role setup occurs during installation. Please refer to the Installation guide for the TopBraid Suite product you are using (EVN, TBI, TopBraid
	Live, etc.) – see for example http://www.topquadrant.com/docs/tbl/42install/installation.html.
</p>
<p>
	For a Role to be used in a TopBraid server, the role must:
</p>
<p>
	1) Be defined in a Tomcat Realm, such as LDAP, and
</p>
<p>
	2) Appear in the Permitted security roles setup of the TopBraid (which define entries for security-constraint tags in the application’s web.xml).
</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<div>
					<p>
						In-memory user database (e.g. conf/tomcat-users.xml)
					</p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<div>
					<p>
						LDAP User Directory
					</p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	To define Roles in the Permitted security roles, enter a comma-delimited list of Roles in the TopBraid Deployment Descriptor Configuration Page during
	installation. The following figures show the most common setups for LDAP and in-memory database (conf/tomcat-users.xml), where the role names in either
	case are Role1, Role2 and Role3. Note that these roles are defined in LDAP/Tomcat and are not editable from within TopBraid.
</p>
<h2>
	<a name="_Toc260381645">1.1 Access to Server Administration Page</a>
</h2>
<p>
	Once installation is completed, the Server Administration page can be access by users associated with a Role with access to the asset ANY_ROLE. The Role
	Management page is found at Server Administration &gt; Role Management.
</p>
<p>
	This setup replaces the Superuser setting in versions of TopBraid Suite prior to version 4.4.
</p>
<h2>
	<a name="_Toc260381646">1.2 AdministratorGroup</a>
</h2>
<p>
	TopBraid Role Manager includes a default administrator group, named AdministratorGroup, which allows access to all assets. The group must be defined for at
	least one Role to prevent being locked out of the system. By default, all Roles are defined to have this group.
</p>
<p>
	To remove AdminstratorGroup for a specific role the user must define another role for the group. If AdministratorGroup is defined for at least one other
	group it can be removed. However, if no other groups are associated with AdministratorGroup, it cannot be deleted.
</p>

</h1>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

				<div>
					<p align="center">
						Role Management Views.
					</p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	The Role Management UI consists of two views: Role Management and Group Management. To navigate between them, click on the column name as shown in the
	following figure.
</p>
<p>
	Definitions for concepts appearing in this user interface are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Roles:</strong>
	Roles are defined in LDAP/Tomcat and cannot be edited in this interface – a systems administrator will need to modify these using LDAP/AD,
	tomcat-users.xml, etc. A Role can be associated with one or more Groups.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Groups</strong>
	: A group is defined within TBS and it identifies a group of assets, their respective access types and role/s defined in a user directory that it maps to.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Asset</strong>
	: An asset is an instance of a resource that can be uniquely identified within TBS. Example of an asset is graph, SM script, an exposed Web service, a file
	etc. The approach controls access to individual asset or a group of assets.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Asset Permissions</strong>
: Each asset type allows a set of asset permissions. These permission types are <strong><u>C</u></strong>reate, <strong><u>R</u></strong>ead,	<strong><u>U</u></strong>pdate, <strong><u>D</u></strong>elete and <strong><u>E</u></strong>xecute. E.g. for a graph CRUD access can be specified, for a SM
	script CRUD+E are relevant whereas for an exposed Web service only E access is relevant.

	Defining New Groups
</h2>
<p>
	To define a new group, click on the Groups column and click on the Add Group button. Provide a name as shown in in the figure. Groups can be associated
	with one or more Asset with access permissions
</p>

	<a name="_Ref260315086">2.2 Defining Asset Permissions</a>
</h2>
<p>
	Asset Permissions are defined with the Add Asset button on the Group Management view (1 in the figure). Asset Types are defined in Section 5. You can
	choose a listed wildcard asset type <u>OR</u> click ‘next’ to choose from a list of specific assets. For example, click “Next&gt;” and the full set of
	Eclipse/Equinox projects from the TopBraid workspace will be displayed (2 in the figure). In this example, which corresponds to a TopBraid EVN setup, the
	default EVNProjects project name has been chosen. Upon choosing the asset type the Group Management view will display a set of permissions corresponding to
	the aforementioned CRUD+E asset permissions. In this figure all asset permission have been chosen – meaning that any role assigned to the group EVN User
	has access to all graphs and Web services defined for the project “EVNProjects” (3 in the figure).
</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>

			<td>
				<div>
					<p align="center">
						Creating Asset Permissions.
					</p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	This corresponds to a suggested setup for TopBraid EVN where all users have access rights so that users with EVN “manager” roles (EVN User Roles) are free
