      <h1>Introduction to the Enterprise Vocabulary Net Enterprise Server</h1>
      <p>Enterprise Vocabulary Net (EVN) Enterprise Server is designed using Java servlet technology and deployed using a Web Application Server, also known as a
         Servlet Container, 
         	  such as Apache Tomcat or Oracle WebLogic.  Installation consists of deploying the WAR (Web Application Archive) file in
         the application server.
      </p>
      <p>The WAR file is obtained by contacting TopQuadrant sales to receive the login/password for downloading the Enterprise Vocabulary Net install files.  
         	The install files consist of  the WAR file for Enterprise Vocabulary Net (evn.war) and the EVN Installation Guide (this document).
      </p>
      <p>
         The installation of Enterprise Vocabulary Net (EVN) is slightly different depending on both the operating system and Web Application Server. Detailed 
         instructions for <a href="installation.html#tomcat-installation-instructions">Tomcat</a>, <a href="installation.html#installation-instructions-for-linux">Tomcat under Linux</a> and <a href="installation.html#installation-instructions-for-windows-2003">Tomcat under Windows Server 2003</a> are provided in the sections below.  In general, installation 
         consists of:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>Deploying the Enterprise Vocabulary Net WAR file in the application server.  For Tomcat, this involves copying the evn.war file to the Tomcat <tt>webapps</tt> 
               directory, or using Tomcat Manager to deploy evn.war.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>(Optional) Setting the location of the EVN workspace.  By default, the workspace is set to /var/lib/ontologies.  Upon deployment 
               		of the EVN application, library files will be written to this folder, including TopBraid (system library for TopBraid Suite features),
               
               		server.topbraidlive.org (EVN server files for sessions, etc.), and other TopBraid Suite features.  This folder will also contain all 
               		projects uploaded to the server.  See <a href="installation.html#uploadsemwebapp">Uploading Semantic Applications and Data to Enterprise Vocabulary Net</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The location of the workspace can be changed by editing the <tt>init-param</tt> element in $APP_HOME/webapps/tbl/WEB-INF/web.xml, where $APP_HOME is 
               		the home directory of the application server.
            </p>
            <p>If permissions for the user running the application server are insufficient to write to the /var/lib/ontologies folder, full
               deployment of 
               		Enterprise Vocabulary Net will not succeed.  Edit the web.xml to a folder with write permissions and re-start the application server.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>(Optional) Setting authentication and role-based access control through Tomcat or a LDAP server.  These are explained in more
               detail throughout this document. 
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
